There are two causal concepts (This and This2) and three affected concepts (That, That2, and That3). There is a VH positive relationship between This and That. Check whether when This increases from 0 to 100, so does That. There is a VH negative relationship between This2 and That. Check whether when This2 decreases from 100 to 0, if That increases from 0 to 100. That2 and That3 are included to test te effects of positive and negative feedback respectively. That2 grows at twice the rate of That. That3 grows at half the rate of That."]}
